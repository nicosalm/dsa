data structures &amp; algorithms, plus some other stuff!

## rules for me
- i must first create the data structure or algorithm in C, before i can create it in {Python, Rust, Go}
  - i believe this helps me understand the thing i'm making beyond it's Big O
- that said, have good Big O
- no looking at implementations, only language docs and definitions
  - if it shows "how to code it" vs "what it should do", it's cheating
- (optional) implement both naive and optimized versions when applicable
  - idea: understanding why optimization matters; reality: this will probably get annoying
- add NOTES.md for each implementation to log mistakes & lessons learned

## organization
`category/algorithm-name/language/(implementation files)`

categories so far: arrays â€¢ linked-lists
